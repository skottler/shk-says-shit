Integrating Icinga with Puppet, Chef, and Ansible
--------------------------------------------------

Configuration management and monitoring go hand-in-hand, but people often
manage configuration and monitoring state in completely different ways. In this
talk I'll talk about and juxtapose different techniques available across the
most popular configuration management tools for orchestrating monitoring
systems. Although this talk with focus on managing Icinga and gathering host,
service, and device data, most of the information will also be applicable to
Nagios, Naemon, and other popular monitoring tools.
